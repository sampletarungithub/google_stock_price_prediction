The objective of this project is to predict Google (Alphabet Inc.) stock prices using historical market data and machine learning/time-series techniques to analyze trends and forecast future price movements.

Data Collection & Understanding
Historical stock market data is collected, including features such as opening price, closing price, high, low, trading volume, and date.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is performed to study price trends, volatility, moving averages, and trading volume patterns over time.

Data Preprocessing

Missing values are handled.

Date is converted into time-series format.

Features are scaled to improve model performance.

Lag features and rolling statistics are created.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and price momentum are engineered to capture market behavior.

Model Development
Time-series and machine learning models such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, or Random Forest are trained to predict future stock prices.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE to measure prediction accuracy.

Price Prediction
The trained model predicts future Google stock prices based on historical trends and indicators.

Conclusion
The project provides insights into stock price behavior and supports data-driven forecasting, though predictions are subject to market risks and volatility.
